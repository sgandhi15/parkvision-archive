# ParkVision - Smart Parking Detection System

## Overview

ParkVision is an intelligent parking management system that uses computer vision to detect and monitor parking spot availability in real-time. The system processes surveillance camera feeds to identify empty parking spaces and provides this information to users through a modern web interface.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS

## Key Features

- Real-time parking spot detection using computer vision
- Live monitoring of parking space availability
- User-friendly web interface for checking parking status
- Centralized data storage and management
- Scalable cloud-based architecture
